However, [in the first century the citizens of Antioch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity_in_the_1st_century) started to call Christ's disciples ["Christians"](/bible/concepts/christian) which means "those who believe in Christ" (Acts 11:26). 

This was initially intended to be [an insult](https://www.truthrightlydivided.com/why-are-we-called-christians/) by the unbelievers who rejected the teachings of Christ (Acts 26:24-28; 1 Peter 4:12-16). However, the name became common and Christianity became the official name of this new religion.
