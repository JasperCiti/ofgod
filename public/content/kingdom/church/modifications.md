The [Church History](/church/history) have a significant impact on how translators interpret and modified the Bible to fit their doctrines.

# Changes to support the Trinity doctrine
* [God's name was removed](/god/father/name) (which blur the difference between God with Jesus).
* Some bibles capitalised all references to Jesus to [imply that Jesus is God](/god/son/essence/as-god).
* ["The Word"](/bible/concepts/word) is capitalised to imply that Jesus as God.
* "The Word" and "the Holy Spirit" were personified in favour of the [Trinity doctrine](/bible/doctrines/trinitarian).
* Adding words to the bible in favour of [the Trinity](/bible/doctrines/trinitarian), for example compare <BibleVerse reference="1 John 5:7-8" translation="ESV" /> in KJV with other translations like ESV, NIV, NLT, NASB95, DARBY, CSB, HCSB.
* Unrelated cross-references were added, for example supposed [references to Jesus in the Old Testament](/bible/books/psalms) to "proof" that Jesus is God.
* Some bibles print Jesus' words in a bold red colour, but God's words are printed in the usual font, for example [<BibleVerse reference="Luke 3:22" translation="ESV" /> NIV](https://www.biblica.com/bible/niv/luke/3/). This gives the impression that only Jesus is God or that Jesus' words are more important than God's.
* The ["with" preposition was changed to "in"](/bible/translations/differences/en) (to make Jesus seem more god-like).

# Changes to make the bible less Jewish or more Christian
* Persons' names were changed (to make it English, but lost the meaning of those names).
* Books' names were changed (to make it less Jewish, but it distorts the purpose of some books).
* The division between the Old Testament and the New Testament (to deprecate the "Jewish laws" as being taught by [the book of Hebrew](/bible/books/hebrews)).
* Certain keywords were changed for example:
  * "assembly of Jesus' disciples" → "church" (this replaces discipleship or [the body of Christ](/body) with a church system)
  * "Messiah" → ["Christ"](/bible/concepts/christ) (in favour of Christianity)
  * "Torah" → "law" (which discourages people to study the deprecated those "laws" of the "Old" Testament)
* Terms like "the cross" and "crucifixion" were added in favour of Christianity which is identified with a [cross symbol](/bible/symbolism/cross).
* Terms like ["communion", "the Lord's Supper", "Eucharist"](/life/communion/terminology) and so forth were added in favour of church creeds.

# Changes made for convenience
* Some [books were omitted](/bible/books/apocrypha) (to support the early church father's views).
* Some [books were added](/bible/books) (to support the early church father's views).
* The order of the books were changed (to find popular books first at the cost of the chronological order of events).
* Chapters and verses were added (to lookup verses quickly, but at the cost of losing the context of the text).
* Footnotes and titles were added in favour of the translator's views.
* Certain keywords were changed for example:
  * "the authority of ..." → ["the name of ..."](/bible/concepts/name) (it is easier to call a magic "name", than to submit under authority)
  * "revelation of a secret" → ["mystery"](/bible/concepts/mystery) (to escape contradictions)
* Punctuation and quotation makes were added according to the translator's view (for example compare John 3 in different bible translations where it is [unclear where Jesus' dialogue stops and where John's commentary starts](/god/son/essence/as-god/incarnation/heaven))
* The devil was given the name "Satan" (to identify him, but honours him as an important person).

# Changes made in favour of the Church
Some churches add a rule book, creeds or declarations that state that:
* [Church membership](/church/history/7-sacraments) is necessary for [salvation](/eternal/saved)
* [Submission under the church leadership](/church/history/papal-authority) is necessary for [salvation](/eternal/saved)
* Paying money to the church will release [financial blessings](/life/wealth/tithing) or [eternal rewards](/church/history/7-sacraments)
