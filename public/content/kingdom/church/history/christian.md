However, [in the first century the citizens of Antioch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity_in_the_1st_century) started to call Christ's disciples ["Christians"](/bible/concepts/christian) which means "those who believe in Christ" (<BibleVerse reference="Acts 11:26" translation="ESV" />). 

This was initially intended to be [an insult](https://www.truthrightlydivided.com/why-are-we-called-christians/) by the unbelievers who rejected the teachings of Christ (<BibleVerse reference="Acts 26:24-28" translation="ESV" />; <BibleVerse reference="1 Peter 4:12-16" translation="ESV" />). However, the name became common and Christianity became the official name of this new religion.
