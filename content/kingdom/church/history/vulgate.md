[The Jews used Koine Greek, especially in the Septuagint, to communicate with Gentiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_Koine_Greek) at the time [the Gospels](/bible/books) was written. [Koine Greek was the lingua franca of the Eastern Mediterranean following Alexander the Great's conquests.](https://bibleinterp.arizona.edu/articles/2015/09/gle398009)

Therefore, [in 382 AD, the Bible (Vulgate) was translated into Latin by St. Jerome](https://amazingbibletimeline.com/blog/vulgate-the-latin-bible/) as per recommendations of Pope Damascus the First. 

[St. Jerome utilised sources such as the Vetus Latina, Hebrew texts, and the Greek Septuagint.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_of_Jerome_to_Pope_Damasus) In addition, [St. Jerome also translated the books Judith and Tobit from Aramaic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulgate). 

The composite collection of these texts were called the ["Biblia Vulgata"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulgate) (Bible in common tongue). 

St. Jerome, was a staunch supporter of [Nicene orthodoxy](/church/history/state-religion), which upheld [the doctrine of the Trinity](/bible/doctrines/trinitarian) and opposed [Arianism](/church/history/arianism). Therefore, certain ambiguous texts would have likely been translated in favour of the Nicene orthodoxy.

This translation eventually became [the standard Latin version of the Bible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulgate) for the Western churches where [Latin gradually became a prominent language](https://bibleinterp.arizona.edu/articles/2015/09/gle398009) under Roman rule.

Many early vernacular [translations](/bible/translations), such as [the Wycliffe Bible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wycliffe) (first Middle English translation) and the Douay-Rheims Bible, were directly based on the Vulgate. This English translation remained [the standard for Roman Catholics until the 20th century](https://www.britannica.com/topic/biblical-translation). Likewise, [many other modern Catholic bible translations also used the Vulgate as a source](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Vulgate) for example: Confraternity Bible (1941), Knox Bible (1945), Jerusalem Bible (1966), RSV-CE (1966), Nova Vulgata (1979) and NRSV-CE (1989).
